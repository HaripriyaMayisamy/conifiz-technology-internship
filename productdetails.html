        <h2> COCONUT OIL</h2>
        <p>
           <br><b>Coconut oil is made up of about 90% saturated fats and 9% unsaturated fats. <br>
           However, the saturated fats in it differ from saturated fats in animal fats. <br>
           Over 50% of the fats in coconut oil are medium chain fatty acids, such as lauric acid (12:0).<br>
           Coconut oil is the highest natural source of lauric acid.</b>

        <h2> GROUNDNUT OIL</h2>
        <p>
            <br><b>The groundnut or peanut is a species in the family Fabaceae (commonly
             known as the bean, pea or legume family). <br>Groundnut oil, also known as
             peanut oil or arachis oil is a mild tasting vegetable oil derived from peanuts.<br>
             Groundnut oil is a kind of light yellow transparent edible oil with clear color
             and lecture, pleasant fragrance and good taste, is relatively easy to digest.<br>
             Groundnut oil contains more than 80% unsaturated fatty acids (including
             41.2%oleic acid and 37.6%linoleic acid). <br>It also contains 19.9% of palmitic
             acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids. <br>The fatty
             acid composition of peanut oil is relatively good, therefore it is easy for
             human bodies to digest and absorb. <br>The groundnut is an annual herbaceous
             plant growing 30 to 50 cm (1.0 to 1.6 ft) tall.

        <h2>CASTOR OIL</h2><br>
        <p>
            <b>Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis L.) mainly cultivated in India, South America, Africa.<br>
                Castor oil is a rich source of Ricinoleic acid, which represents up to 90% of the total castor oil content. <br>
                It also consists up to 4% linoleic, 3% oleic, 1% stearic, and less than 1% linolenic fatty acids 1.<br>
                Ricinoleic acid has a hydroxyl group that provides a functional group location for various chemical reactions, making it a favourable substance in industrial applications.
